# GPS-to-Speedometer
Brief program that converts a list of GPS positions to speeds, then saves those real-time speed values as an MP4 video file. I wrote this so that I could display a real time speed as a video overlay on any FPV or GoPro footage I use in combination with my GPS module. The resulting video file has a green background so that it can be easily keyed out in any video editing software. 

See demo video for how to use and more information!
